ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES
====================

• How to import data (rake tasks?)
• How to structure requests (hit cached data first, then request updates using nokogiri)
• Determine average value based on all realms as well as per realm/faction
• Cache images (use S3?)
• Schedule grabs of item data with resque (for post-patches etc.)

OTHER STUFF
===========

• Add hearthstone-inspired icon to root of breadcrumb trail
• Change main item link to be a link to wowbom
• Add a wowhead link as a rocket icon
• Show number of items created by a spell (e.g.<spell id="80237" name="Transmute: Shadowspirit Diamond" icon="inv_misc_metagemuncut_b" minCount="2" maxCount="2">)
• Add a route for items by name (see https://gist.github.com/47648fb3fb87fa2cd531#file_wowhead.textile)
• Indicate the source (i.e. rarity) of the recipe itself
• Show BoP items and guideline prices for them (e.g. orbs)
• Determine if an item would be cheaper to craft using sub-materials (e.g. ore instead of bars etc.)
  – Expand each item in a recipe to provide controls for pricing that way
• Implement a persistence layer for wowecon (item value) and wowhead (items/recipes) data
• Implement a preferences UI for setting your preferred region, realm and faction (save using localstorage)
• Use localstorage for persistence on top of any app-level persistence
• Refine existing JS to be fit for purpose (i.e. remove extraneous stuff)
• Add find-as-you-type to below the search box
• Trends graphs to show how prices of a given item have fluctuated — http://g.raphaeljs.com/
• Find out how to address all icons (integer prefix to filepath changes?)
• iPhone stylesheet
• Branding / better look & feel
  – New buttons (see http://eu.battle.net/wow/static/images/sidebar/bg-wow.jpg for inspiration)
• Registration: save preferences (realm, faction) and link to your character profile:
  – Recipes you know
  – Most profitable recipes based on current market data and item availability
• Use Blizzard armoury data wherever possible

THINK ABOUT:

• Adverts?
• How else to make this profitable — mailing list signups

TODOS:

• Bypass wowecon for items sold by vendors
• Add a route for items by name
• Indicate the source (i.e. rarity) of the recipe itself
• Determine if an item would be cheaper to craft using sub-materials (e.g. ore instead of bars etc.)
• Implement a persistence layer for wowecon (item value) and wowhead (items/recipes) data
• Implement a preferences UI for setting your preferred region, realm and faction (save using localstorage)
• Use localstorage for persistence on top of any app-level persistence
• Refine existing JS to be fit for purpose (i.e. remove extraneous stuff)
• Add find-as-you-type to below the search box
• Update the design of the recipe card to include the item's icon (use icons from battle.net — e.g. http://eu.battle.net/wow-assets/static/images/icons/56/inv_misc_bone_09.jpg)

TODOS:

• Bypass wowecon for items sold by vendors
• Add a route for items by name
• Indicate the source (i.e. rarity) of the recipe itself
• Show BoP items and guideline prices for them (e.g. orbs)
• Determine if an item would be cheaper to craft using sub-materials (e.g. ore instead of bars etc.)
• Implement a persistence layer for wowecon (item value) and wowhead (items/recipes) data
• Implement a preferences UI for setting your preferred region, realm and faction (save using localstorage)
• Use localstorage for persistence on top of any app-level persistence
• Refine existing JS to be fit for purpose (i.e. remove extraneous stuff)
• Add find-as-you-type to below the search box
• Trends graphs to show how prices of a given item have fluctuated

THINK ABOUT:

• Adverts?
• How else to make this profitable

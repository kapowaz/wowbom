ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES
====================

• Determine average value based on all realms as well as per realm/faction
• Schedule grabs of item data with resque (for post-patches etc.)
• Schedule grabs of auction house data from the community API

WORKER QUEUES
=============

• Prices
• Items
• Recipes
• Realms

OTHER STUFF
===========

• User authentication using sinatra_warden (https://github.com/jsmestad/sinatra_warden) and dm-is-authenticatable (https://github.com/postmodern/dm-is-authenticatable)
• Add a selection of popular item recipes to the homepage
• Add a route for items by name (see https://gist.github.com/47648fb3fb87fa2cd531#file_wowhead.textile)
• Indicate the source (i.e. rarity) of the recipe itself
• Determine if an item would be cheaper to craft using sub-materials (e.g. ore instead of bars etc.)
  – Expand each item in a recipe to provide controls for pricing that way
• Implement a preferences UI for setting your preferred region, realm and faction (save using localstorage?)
• Use localstorage for persistence on top of any app-level persistence
• Refine existing JS to be fit for purpose (i.e. remove extraneous stuff)
• Add find-as-you-type to below the search box
• Trends graphs to show how prices of a given item have fluctuated — http://g.raphaeljs.com/
• Find out how to address all icons (integer prefix to filepath changes?)
• iPhone stylesheet
• Branding / better look & feel
  – New buttons (see http://eu.battle.net/wow/static/images/sidebar/bg-wow.jpg for inspiration)
• Registration: save preferences (realm, faction) and link to your character profile:
  – Recipes you know (see: http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/#id3682393 and http://eu.battle.net/api/wow/character/Alonsus/Elethiomel?fields=professions)
  – Most profitable recipes based on current market data and item availability
• Use Blizzard armoury data wherever possible!

THINK ABOUT:

• Adverts?
• How else to make this profitable — mailing list signups
